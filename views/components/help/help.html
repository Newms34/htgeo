    <p>Welcome to the Brethren [PAIN] (henceforth known as “Brethren”, because writing that guild tag stuff is annoying) Guild Wars 2 Guild website! This is basically just a tool I (Dave Newman/Portable Healy Unit) wrote to make organizing guild stuff easier. The site has a bunch of sections that you may find useful.</p>
    <h4><a id="sections"></a>Sections</h4>
    <p>There are five major sections of the site:</p>
    <ul class='contents'>
        <li><strong>The Dashboard:</strong> View/edit your personal information (including characters), send and receive messages, look at other members’ profiles, and see upcoming events</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar:</strong> View and create/edit events. This is still a bit of a WIP, but it allows/will allow Brethren members to create events on a nice, convenient calendar.</li>
        <li><strong>Chat:</strong> You can chat. The chat here is <em>not</em> preserved (i.e., I cannot retrieve your week old conversation), but still, be nice.</li>
        <li><strong>Forums:</strong> Got a message you want everyone to see? Post it here. You can even include (small) pictures! As always, be nice. I’ve included an voting system for each post (yes, like <a class='no-blue-link' href="https://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>), so feel free to tell each other how stupid/awesome you think your ideas are</li>
        <li><strong>Help:</strong> You’re looking at it. Hi!</li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a id="accounts"></a>Accounts</h3><a class='no-blue-link' href="#top"><i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i></a>
    <p>Before using the site (and actually, viewing this page), you’re gonna need to create a account. You may note that creating an account involves <em>just</em> creating a username and passsword, and <em>not</em> any other information. This is because while that other info (i.e., your characters, preferred game mode, etc.) is cool, I don’t want to <em>force</em> you to make it before you sign up.</p>
    <h4><a id="confirming"></a>Confirming</h4>
    <p>Once you’ve created your account, you’ll need it to be confirmed. This is so that while anyone can <em>create</em> an account, only users confirmed by Brethren site moderators can actually view the site. Trolls r bad, k?</p>

    <h3><a id="terms-of-service"></a>Terms of Service</h3><a class='no-blue-link' href="#top"><i class="fa fa-caret-up"></i></a>
    <p><em>Please note: these are NOT legally binding. That doesn’t mean you get free reign, tho!</em>
        <br>
        <strong>Use:</strong> As a user of <a class='no-blue-link' href="http://brethrenpain.herokuapp.com">brethrenpain.herokuapp.com</a> (henceforth, “the site”), you agree to not attempt to bypass any security measures, access any account other than your own, or otherwise tamper with/compromise the site itself. You agree that any information you post on this site is released in the public domain, except where otherwise previously owned by copyright holders (i.e., in-game screenshots, which are property of ArenaNet).TL;DR: Don’t post stuff that infringes copyright and then attempt to blame Dave for it. I really don’t have time to deal with that.
        <br>
        <strong>Liability:</strong> You agree that the site is not responsible for anything you post here, and that blaming Dave for whatever stupidity you post is just really uncool.
        <br>
        <strong>Arbitration/Moderation:</strong> You agree that in all disputes, the site moderators have the final say, and that in disputes involving moderators, Dave has the final say. Don’t piss off Dave.
        <br>
        <strong>Account Termination/Banning:</strong> If you really piss us off, we’ll ban you. If you’re banned, you <em>can</em> beg us to unban you in game, but if we decide not to, that’s it. Don’t make another account to attempt to circumvent the ban. Since we need to confirm all accounts anyway, it won’t work.
        <br>
        <strong>Affiliation:</strong> We’re not affiliated with anyone. Not ArenaNet, Guild Wars 2, <em>any</em>one. We’re kinda affiliated with the Brethren guild, but that’s it. So if someone posts something like “ArenaNet Official statement: ArenaNet hates Asuras” on here, don’t take that as the gospel truth. Plus, that’d be stupid, because Asuras are awesome.</p>
